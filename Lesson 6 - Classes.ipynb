There is also a **namespace** for included libraries, and one for each function invocation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the pandas, and pyplot libraries; they will be used in your code \n",
    "2. Define a new class `rotation_curve`, and initialize it. The initialization function should take the input  `Galaxy_ID`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `__init__` function, define the instance variable `df_circular`, which creates a  **DataFrame** for the given `Galaxy_ID`. (This corresponds to step 2 in Exercise 3 Tutorial 5.)  Create a test class instance of `rotation_curve`, for a given galaxy ID. Check that for instance, for `Galaxy_ID = 'IC2574'` the following lines\n",

    "\n",

    "4.  Define the class method `update_df_circular` which takes as input the variables `key` and `data`. The method adds a new column  `data` to the **DataFrame** `df_circular`, with keyword `key`. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Define the class method `add_M_DM`, which will add the column `DM Mass (M_sol)` to   the **DataFrame** `df_circular`. (This corresponds to step 3 in Exercise 3, Tutorial 5. Hint, use the `update_df_circular` defined above.) Check that when you run the lines\n",

    "\n",
    "7. We will now proceed to do define a function outside of our class, that plots two columns of  the **DataFrame** `df_circular`, for all of the Galaxy_IDs in the  `Rotation curves` directory. First we need to have a list with all of the `Galaxy_IDs` in the  `Rotation curves` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the **os** library, and the `os.listdir()` function, to create such a list, and remove `'F563-1'` from the list if you got error message when loading it in step 6.\n",
    "* Define the function `plot` that takes as entries two keywords `x` and `y`. It will loop over all of the elements of `Galaxy_IDs`, creating an instance of the class `rotation_curve` for every iteration,  and plot the columns `x` vs `y` in  the  `df_circular` class function.  For instance, if you use that function to plot `'radius (kpc)'` vs `'DM Mass (M_sol)'`, one should get a plot similar to:\n",
