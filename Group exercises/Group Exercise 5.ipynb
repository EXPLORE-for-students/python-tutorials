    "Dark Matter has yet to be detected, but it plays a crucial role in theoretical models of structure formation. According to the current understanding of cosmological structure formation, gravity amplifies the primordial density fluctuations, allowing small over-densities to overcome cosmological expansion and collapse into dark matter halos. Gas flows into these halos, cools radiatively, and forms stars and galaxies. The efficiency with which matter is converted into stars in these haloes depends on a variety of baryonic processes like gas cooling, star and black hole formation and feedback. Over the past decade, significant efforts have been made to comprehend and model these various processes. In this exercise, we will compare the simulated halo mass function with the observed stellar mass function to empirically compute the star formation efficiency in dark matter haloes. The star formation efficiency derived from this data is a powerful tool that can help us perfect our models of structure formation. "
