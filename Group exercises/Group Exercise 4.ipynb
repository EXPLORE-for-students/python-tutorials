    "In this exercise, you will use data from supernovae to constrain the cosmology of the Universe. For each supernova, the main observables are:\n",
    "- Redshift $z$, which tells the supernova's relative velocity to us. \n",
    "- The supernova light curve, i.e., how bright it is as a function of time. Type Ia supernova appear to be \"standard candles\" so that by measuring their brightness, one can infer how far away they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the relationship between redshift vs distance, one can gain an understanding of the expansion of the Universe, which in turn is related to the amount of matter and dark energy, according to the following formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_L(z) = d_H \\, (1+z) \\int_0^z \\frac{dz^\\prime}{\\sqrt{\\Omega_m (1+z^\\prime)^3 + \\Omega_\\Lambda}} \\; , \\qquad (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d_L$ is a measure of distance (luminosity distance), $d_H$ is constant known as the Hubble length, $\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ are the total fractions of matter and dark energy, respectively. Eq. (1) assumes that the Universe has a flat spatial geometry (inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background), so we assume that $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 1 - \\Omega_m$. The Hubble distance is related to the famous Hubble constant $H_0$ by\n",

    "$$d_H = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\approx 3 \\times 10^9 \\; {\\rm parsecs} \\times h^{-1}$$\n",

    "Hubble's analysis in 1929 considered Cepheid variable stars (another standard candle) in nearby galaxies, $z \\approx 0$. In this limit\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_L(z) \\approx d_H z \\qquad (2) \\, .$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$H_0 d_L \\approx c z  \\approx v \\, ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is velocity (along the line of sight). Thus, $v \\propto d_L$ and the constant of proportionality $H_0$ is named in honor of Hubble (although it was first determined by Lemaitre, whose similar work predated Hubble's by two years).\n",
    "\n",
    "For distant objects, such as supernovae, $d_L$ is given by a more complicated function in Eq. (1) and one can extract more information than just $H_0$. The goal of this Exercise is to determine $\\Omega_\\Lambda$, showing that dark energy does indeed exist by finding that $\\Omega_\\Lambda > 0$.\n",
